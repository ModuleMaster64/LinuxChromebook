FIRST TIME SET UP or multiple setups lmao

Check Your Chromebook Compatibility (link in description :D)
Enable Linux (Crostini) by finding linux or linux (beta)
click set up
then press next
enter any username (that is approprite ofc)
and put disk size at however much ur wanting to (Min is 10GB to run. Max is 38.2GB.) 
then press install
installation should take roughly 2-3 mins (depending on how much storage u want it to take fr)

After installation has finished, it should open up the terminal!

Enter the code..

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

also do apt list --upgradable - (to update/upgrade further)

This will ensure your Linux installation is up-to-date with the latest security patches and software updates.

then there you go! you are all ready to use linux!

use google help or search up Linux help if you need any more steps

(this is a brief explanation)

if you want detailed explanation use youtube or smth

Edit 5: python is the best coding language!
